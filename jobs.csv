After one year of hands-on consumer market research, product R&D, and developing the overarching vision and preliminary strategies, I'm now reaching out for key senior management team members to help me build out our product roadmap.  I believe with the right VP of engineering and other key players, along with my proven track record, we can propel this company into revenues of $100 million+ within four years of product launch.
  
About you:
You, as our ideal candidate, will have 10+ years’ experience as a Mechanical Engineer, building and managing small entrepreneurial teams in designing, developing, and manufacturing consumer products.

Ideally you have built and managed teams from the ground up and have worked for multiple start-ups. 
The fact that you may have worked for medium or large companies is not a negative assuming you have sufficient and preferably recent start up experience.

The bottom line is that we need a leader that can:
1.	Move fast and agile - building prototypes quick and cheap demonstrating options quickly, versus big-company-big-budget-long-timeline; 
2.	Bring a high level of creativity (including the know-how of many ways and materials to solve a variety of challenges
3.	Bring a positive “it can be done” attitude
 
Although we expect a lot, I promise you will be given sufficient resources to get the job done.

About the position:
You will report directly to me, hiring and managing a small team of mechanical, electrical, and software engineers, industrial designers, and fabricators which will turn pictures, drawings, specs, illustrations, directions and requirements into working, manufacturable, market-ready products. 

About the project
1.	The consumer company has four core products on its development roadmap of which three incorporate Rom3 revolutionary one-of-a-kind technology for knee & hip replacements, sports injuries and chronic pain conditions
2.	Our five-member patent team have identified 24 unique inventive concepts and technologies that they believe are patentable and are in various stages of filings. (The founding company Rom3 itself has four issued patents and six currently in process.)
3.	The marketplace is the large, ever-growing and shockingly underserved 55+ market for surgery rehab, cardiac rehab, neuromuscular rehab and the title wave condition of obesity and osteoarthritis.
4.	50% of our investors in Rom3 Rehab and the consumer company are doctors or professionals in the medical field that have the unique insight to appreciate the value of the product and the potential of the investment. Most of these same investors are on the Rom3 Board of Advisors and are evangelists for the products of both companies. 

My hiring processes:

My strong preference is to hire key individuals full-time in a consulting role to begin our relationship. This allows both parties to move way beyond the interviewing noise that is inevitable, into the reality of a day-to-day business relationship. Then, based on a mixture of mutual competence, trust and chemistry, the relationship will move to a fully engaged senior executive relationship.

One of the key reasons for considering this opportunity is my experience in taking two companies public along with my experience of having three of my companies acquired. I expect to find the right person for this position and that this person will make a sizable contribution towards our successful public offering and our growth. With that in mind, I expect that our compensation package with salary, staged stock grants and stock options will allow this individual the potential to have “walk away money”, i.e. never having to work again unless one wants to. 

If your talents, experiences, and sense of this job excites you, then let's take the next step. 

Please forward me the following: 
1.	your CV/resume along with a cover letter indicating why this opportunity interests you
2.	why your experiences and talents are relevant to the job as outlined.
3.	your current salary requirements
4.	a list of consumer products which you have personally successfully led the charge in engineering from specs to marketplace 

Please review rom3rehab.com and watch the product video and then review my personal web site michaelbissonnette.com before responding.

Finally, openness, honesty, and candidness are qualities we respond to—as opposed to framing things in the right way with the right words. Please be who you are and let the dice roll.

I am looking forward to your interest

VP of Engineering Level Consultant for Consumer Technology Company,https://newyork.craigslist.org/jsy/egr/d/secaucus-vp-of-engineering-level/6852004125.html,,TBD,full-time,"
        
We are the brain child of a four-year-old medical technology company that has created and patented revolutionary orthopedic rehabilitation devices (Learn more here:  www.rom3rehab.com)
The company has been well-funded, having raised $15 million in the last 14 months, and continues to raise in excess of $500K per month. 

We are now seeking a full-time VP of Engineering Level Consultant, with an extensive track record of bringing new consumer products from specs to market.
My name is Michael Bissonnette, President of ROM3, and Founder/CEO of our one-year-old purposefully unnamed consumer company.  (This is the company that you would be working for-the unnamed one that is.) 

About Me:
Over the last three decades, I founded, funded and built four multimillion-dollar consumer companies from the ground up. The last two grew into international companies that I took public on the NASDAQ including AeroGrow International Inc. (AeroGrow was purchased two years ago by Scotty’s Miracle Grow for $40 million). See my personal website after retiring from AeroGrow: www.michaelbissonnette.com 

After one year of hands-on consumer market research, product R&D, and developing the overarching vision and preliminary strategies, I'm now reaching out for key senior management team members to help me build out our product roadmap.  I believe with the right VP of engineering and other key players, along with my proven track record, we can propel this company into revenues of $100 million+ within four years of product launch.
 
About you:
You, as our ideal candidate, will have 10+ years’ experience as a Mechanical Engineer, building and managing small entrepreneurial teams in designing, developing, and manufacturing consumer products.
Ideally you have built and managed teams from the ground up and have worked for multiple start-ups. 
The fact that you may have worked for medium or large companies is not a negative assuming you have sufficient and preferably recent start up experience.

The bottom line is that we need a leader that can:

1.	Move fast and agile - building prototypes quick and cheap demonstrating options quickly, versus big-company-big-budget-long-timeline; 
2.	Bring a high level of creativity (including the know-how of many ways and materials to solve a variety of challenges
3.	Bring a positive “it can be done” attitude

 Although we expect a lot, I promise you will be given sufficient resources to get the job done.

About the position:

You will report directly to me, hiring and managing a small team of mechanical, electrical, and software engineers, industrial designers, and fabricators which will turn pictures, drawings, specs, illustrations, directions and requirements into working, manufacturable, market-ready products. 
About the project

1.	The consumer company has four core products on its development roadmap of which three incorporate Rom3 revolutionary one-of-a-kind technology for knee & hip replacements, sports injuries and chronic pain conditions
2.	Our five-member patent team have identified 24 unique inventive concepts and technologies that they believe are patentable and are in various stages of filings. (The founding company Rom3 itself has four issued patents and six currently in process.)
3.	The marketplace is the large, ever-growing and shockingly underserved 55+ market for surgery rehab, cardiac rehab, neuromuscular rehab and the title wave condition of obesity and osteoarthritis.
4.	50% of our investors in Rom3 Rehab and the consumer company are doctors or professionals in the medical field that have the unique insight to appreciate the value of the product and the potential of the investment. Most of these same investors are on the Rom3 Board of Advisors and are evangelists for the products of both companies. 

My hiring processes:

My strong preference is to hire key individuals full-time in a consulting role to begin our relationship. This allows both parties to move way beyond the interviewing noise that is inevitable, into the reality of a day-to-day business relationship. Then, based on a mixture of mutual competence, trust and chemistry, the relationship will move to a fully engaged senior executive relationship.

One of the key reasons for considering this opportunity is my experience in taking two companies public along with my experience of having three of my companies acquired. I expect to find the right person for this position and that this person will make a sizable contribution towards our successful public offering and our growth. With that in mind, I expect that our compensation package with salary, staged stock grants and stock options will allow this individual the potential to have “walk away money”, i.e. never having to work again unless one wants to. 

If your talents, experiences, and sense of this job excites you, then let's take the next step. 

Please forward me the following: 
1.	your CV/resume along with a cover letter indicating why this opportunity interests you
2.	why your experiences and talents are relevant to the job as outlined.
3.	your current salary requirements
4.	a list of consumer products which you have personally successfully led the charge in engineering from specs to marketplace 

Please review rom3rehab.com and watch the product video and then review my personal web site michaelbissonnette.com before responding.

Finally, openness, honesty, and candidness are qualities we respond to—as opposed to framing things in the right way with the right words. Please be who you are and let the dice roll.

I am looking forward to your interest

 New York City's leading professional firm dedicated to the preservation of buildings and infrastructure is currently seeking A/E Project Managers with 5+ years of restoration experience.  

As a building envelope restoration consultant SUPERSTRUCTURES works on an array of challenging projects on many of New York's most prominent buildings. We've won frequent awards, as well as the loyalty of some of the premier clients in the region -- public, corporate and residential.  Our work embraces all components of the building envelope and underlying structure - facades, roofs, windows, and plazas - and the full complement of materials, from landmark terra cotta to high performance curtain walls. We take pride in being an industry leader in such practice areas as Local Law 11 inspections and repairs. 

Consistent with our commitment to the advancement of science and art, SUPERSTRUCTURES maintains a dedicated research and development capability.  Innovative construction products and techniques are constantly being researched in a laboratory within our office in which we construct prototypes of devices, and conduct trials of new techniques and methods.  We’re continually exploring cutting edge technologies in NDT&E,  giga-pixel imagery, photogrammetry and point cloud capture, and UAV’s (drones).  We have created, and continue to develop proprietary systems that integrate construction drawings, specifications, cost estimating, scheduling, construction administration, and asset management of buildings and infrastructure. 

We work in teams. Teams are assigned to projects based on synergies between project requirements and the capabilities of each team member. This arrangement offers employees the dual advantages of a ""small office experience"" coupled with access to the centralized resources of a larger firm. You'll be supported by some of the most sophisticated technology in the profession.  

Employees typically participate in all phases of a project from inception through completion: proposal, investigation, construction documents, bid negotiation, and construction administration. You'll have the opportunity to see the designs you draw executed in the field, and you'll take on greater responsibility and client exposure as soon as you are ready.  

Frequent lunchtime seminars by industry experts, including our own in-house personnel, keep us current on developments in the profession (with the additional benefit of a free lunch).  

SUPERSTRUCTURES offers top-level compensation for top-level people, and the advancement potential of a thriving company.  

We are committed to a work / life balance, and to a work week of 40 hours.  When, on occasion, more than 40 hours are required, our employees are compensated for every additional hour worked. 
Our benefits include paid holidays, vacation and sick days, health insurance for employee and family, 401(k) with automatic employer contribution, a continuing education allowance, and free NYC Transit MetroCards.  

Our light-filled office is in a landmarked building with 16' high ceilings, 8' tall windows, and drop dead views in three directions - not a bad place to spend the workday. 

Our Tribeca location is one of New York City's most convenient and vibrant, easily accessible via public transportation. The A, C, and E subway lines stop right in the building. The N, R, #1, and #6 lines are each just a few blocks away.
